# Fashion4Events
A dataset of fashion images for social events


To collect Fashion4Events, a dataset of garment images paired with social event labels, we exploited two different sources of data: the [DeepFashion2](https://github.com/switchablenorms/DeepFashion2) dataset and the [USED](http://loki.disi.unitn.it/~used/) dataset.
Each image is paired with a social event category among the following:

    orig_class_names = ["concert", "graduation", "meeting", "mountain-trip", "picnic",
                   "sea-holiday", "ski-holiday", "wedding", "conference", "exhibition", "fashion",
                   "protest", "sport", "theater-dance"]
